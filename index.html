        <img src="IMAGE1.jpg" alt="Keshab Subedi" width="200">
        
        <p>I am a <strong>biostatistician</strong> with <strong>8 years of experience</strong> in the <strong>design and analysis of clinical trials</strong> and <strong>real-world evidence (RWE) studies</strong>. My expertise lies in applying advanced statistical methodologies to generate meaningful insights in <strong>oncology, cardiology, infectious diseases, and healthcare outcomes research</strong>. I specialize in <strong>survival analysis, mixed-effects modeling, causal inference, and machine learning</strong>, with strong proficiency in <strong>SAS, R, and SQL</strong>.</p>

        <p>I hold an <strong>MS in Biostatistics</strong> from <strong>Drexel University</strong>, a <strong>BS from Tribhuvan University</strong>, and a <strong>graduate certificate in Bioinformatics</strong> from the <strong>University of Delaware</strong>. Recently, I have been particularly interested in <strong>causal inference methods</strong> and their applications in <strong>healthcare economics and outcomes research</strong>, aiming to improve decision-making and patient care through rigorous data analysis.</p>

     
        <p>My research has been published in <strong>high-impact journals</strong>, and I actively contribute to the <strong>scientific community</strong> as a member of the <strong>American Statistical Association (ASA), the International Biometric Society (ENAR), and the Association for Clinical and Translational Science (ACTS)</strong>.</p>

        <p>On the personal side, I am passionate about <strong>community service, volleyball, and hiking</strong>. I play for the <strong>Everest Volleyball Team</strong>, which was the <strong>defending champion</strong> of the <strong>City of Newark Winter Volleyball League (B Division)</strong>. Beyond sports, I have a deep love for the outdoors and have <strong>hiked many peaks</strong> across the <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>Nepal</strong>, embracing the challenge and adventure that come with exploring nature.</p>
