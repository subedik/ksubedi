    <h2>Personal Life & Photos</h2>
    <p>
         I try to follow the Buddhist approach to understand and live life. I find it a very systematic and methodological way to look at life and live meaningfully. Buddhism proposes the Four Noble Truths as it comes to life:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Dukkha (Suffering Exists)</strong> – Life is filled with suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence. This includes physical pain, emotional distress, and the existential struggles of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Samudaya (Cause of Suffering)</strong> – The root of suffering is craving (tanha) and attachment, whether to desires, possessions, status, or even ideas. Our attachment leads to endless cycles of dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering)</strong> – By letting go of attachment and craving, suffering can be ceased. Enlightenment (Nirvana) is the state of peace and liberation from suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Magga (Path to the End of Suffering)</strong> – The way to end suffering is through the Eightfold Path, a disciplined and mindful way of living that leads to wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline.
    </p>
    <h3>The Eightfold Path</h3>
    <p>
        The Eightfold Path is the practical guide to overcoming suffering and achieving enlightenment. It is divided into three categories: Wisdom (Prajna), Ethical Conduct (Sila), and Mental Discipline (Samadhi).
    </p>
    <h4>1. Wisdom (Prajna)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right View (Samma Ditthi)</strong> – Understanding reality as it is, especially the Four Noble Truths. It is about seeing life without illusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Intention (Samma Sankappa)</strong> – Cultivating the right thoughts and intentions, free from ill will, cruelty, and attachment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Ethical Conduct (Sila)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right Speech (Samma Vaca)</strong> – Speaking truthfully, kindly, and constructively while avoiding gossip, lies, or harmful speech.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Action (Samma Kammanta)</strong> – Acting ethically by avoiding harm to others, refraining from stealing, and leading a moral life.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva)</strong> – Earning a living in an honest and ethical way, without harming others or exploiting beings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Mental Discipline (Samadhi)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right Effort (Samma Vayama)</strong> – Diligently cultivating positive states of mind and eliminating negative ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati)</strong> – Being aware of one's thoughts, actions, and surroundings with clarity and presence.</li>
        <li><strong>Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi)</strong> – Developing deep states of meditation to cultivate wisdom and inner peace.</li>
    </ul>

This is the second-highest bungee jump in the world, a true test of courage and a moment of pure adrenaline. Plunging into the depths of this mighty gorge, with the roaring river below and the Himalayas in the backdrop, was an unforgettable adventure!.</div>

            <div class="caption">I was born and grew up in these mountains, where life was pure, and nature was more pristine than one can imagine. The towering peaks, winding trails, and endless greenery shaped my early years, teaching me resilience, simplicity, and a deep appreciation for the world around me. Though life has taken me far from these hills, their spirit remains within me—guiding my journey, grounding my values, and reminding me of where it all began..</div>
